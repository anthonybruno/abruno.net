## Anthony Bruno ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an Engineering Manager with 15+ years of frontend experience, now focused on leading teams and building systems that scale. My career has grown from shipping polished, accessible web platforms to shaping the culture, practices, and workflows that make teams successful.

I focus on enabling teams to do their best work by creating clarity in messy spaces, removing obstacles, and building strong partnerships across product and design. For me, leadership means helping people grow and building environments where ideas flow openly and problems get solved together.
